## 🔔 SOCKET.IO NOTIFICATION SYSTEM

When an event reaches full capacity:

```javascript
// Server emits to all participants:
io.emit("eventFull", {
  eventId: "123",
  message: "Үйл явдал дүүрсэн байна! Бэлэн болоорой!"
});

// Client receives and shows popup:
socket.on('eventFull', (data) => {
  // Shows animated notification
  // Auto-dismisses after 5 seconds
});
```
